# Struct-of-Program-Languages-project
my final project code assignment


I wanted to code to explain a difference between the two languages over garbage collection but I could not think of a way to code it yet so to explain garbage collection in c++ you have to do this manually and have a file named main if we want to compile 2 at the same time

java does not have a deconstructor like c++ has and instead does it within the language itself


next c++ does have the ability to pass by value and reference as we have been taught about it

the code are partly pseduocode that are made to just give an example on pass by reference done by c++ and javas only ability to pass by value which is a major difference in the two paradigms
 
 the code does still have placeholder text since I did not decide what the couts should be for the final compilation and figured it did not really matter since the code got to the point of the assignment
